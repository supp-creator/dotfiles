;;; Commentary:

;; fedi.el provides a bunch of untility functions and macros (originally
;; adopted from the popular mastodon.el
;; <https://codeberg.org/martianh/mastodon.el> package) to make it easy to
;; write clients and interfaces for for JSON APIs.

;; If provides an http request library, buffer setup macro, and functions
;; for prev/next/tab navigation and acting on, and creation of,
;; hypertextual elements, functions for text formatting and icons, live
;; updating timestamps, bulk buffer handling, as well as a
;; completing-read, action, then update view set of functions, and a rich
;; posting interface.

;;; Code:

(require 'fedi-http)

(defvar fedi-instance-url nil
  "The URL of the instance to connect to.")

(defvar fedi-package-prefix nil
  "The name of your package, without following dash.
Used to construct function names in `fedi-request'.")

  :group 'external)

;;; REQUEST MACRO
;; this is an example of a request macro for defining request functions.
;; `lem.el' now defines its own rather than wrapping around this, for
;; simplicity, and you probably don't want to use it either, but you can still
;; use it as a guide to writing your own. see also `lem-def-request' in
;; `lem-api.el'.
;; (defmacro fedi-request
;;     (method name endpoint
;;             &optional args docstring params man-params opt-bools json headers)
;;   "Create a http request function NAME, using http METHOD, for ENDPOINT.
;; ARGS are for the function.
;; PARAMS is an list of elements from which to build an alist of
;; form parameters to send with the request.
;; MAN-PARAMS is an alist, to append to the one created from PARAMS.
;; JSON means to encode params as a JSON payload.
;; HEADERS is an alist that will be bound as `url-request-extra-headers'.

;; This macro is designed to generate functions for fetching data
;; from JSON APIs.

;; To use it, you first need to set `fedi-package-prefix' to the
;; name of your package, and set `fedi-instance-url' to the URL of
;; an instance of your fedi service.

;; The name of functions generated with this will be the result of:
;; \(concat fedi-package-prefix \"-\" name).

;; The full URL for the endpoint is constructed by `fedi-http--api',
;; which see. ENDPOINT does not require a preceding slash.

;; For example, to make a GET request, called PKG-search to endpoint /search:

;; \(fedi-request \"get\" \"search\" \"search\"
;;   (q)
;;   \"Make a GET request.
;; Q is the search query.\"
;;   \\=(q))

;; This macro doesn't handle authenticated requests, as these differ
;; between services. But you can easily wrap it in another macro
;; that handles auth by providing info using HEADERS or AUTH-PARAM."

A param can also be an expression, in which case the car should be the

that may contain the fields :boolean, :alias, :when and :list.
:boolean should be a string, either \"true\" or \"false\".
:alias should be the name of the parameter as it is on the server.
:when should be a condition clause to test against rather than the mere
value of the parameter symbol
:list should be a list of values for the parameter.

For example:

\(fedi-opt-params (query :alias \"q\") (topic :boolean \"true\")
